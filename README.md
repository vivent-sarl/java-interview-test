# Vivent Java Interview Test

Welcome to the Vivent Software Engineer interview test!

We collect (a lot of) electrophysiological signals from plants. In order to ensure reliable, continuous data streams, we use Kafka as our data pipeline. It's important to us that our Software Engineers can work across the whole data pipeline, all the way to the user.

During the coding excercises, you will use this repository as entry point. Make sure to have you favourite Java IDE ready, and import this code.
